At least one copy of APOE-e4   rs3865444_T Genetic adni-merge The less common allele for this SNP, rs3865444(T), is associated with a slight decrease in risk for Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease, on the order of 0.9x (i.e. a 10% decrease in risk).   rs11136000_T Genetic adni-merge rs11136000 is a SNP associated with the clusterin CLU gene, which has also been known as the APOJ gene. A study of over 5,000 Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease patients (and over 10,000 controls) found a slight protective effect of the (T) allele of this SNP. rs11136000(T) carriers had a slightly decreased risk for Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease, with an odds ratio of 0.84 (CI: 0.8-0.9, p=1.4x10e-9). The association of this SNP and late-onset Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease was replicated over a total of another 1829 cases (and 2576 controls).   rs10498633_T Genetic adni-merge A 22-single nucleotide polymorphism associated with Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease risk   DX status \u0026ndash; – adni-merge Subject’s clinical diagnosis   Conversion – adni-merge Describes the participant\u0026rsquo;s change in cognitive status during the study.   MMSE – adni-merge Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): is a global assessment of cognitive status (Folstein et al., 1975).The MMSE is a fully structured scale that consists of 30 points grouped into seven categories. A perfect score is 30 points, a score of 24 is the recommended, and most frequently used, cutpoint for dementia, a score of 23 or lower indicates dementia   MOCA – adni-merge Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). was designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: a ttention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Time to administer the MoCA is approximately 10 minutes. The total possible score is 30 points, a score of 26 or above is considered normal. This test was not applied in ADNI-I   ADAS 11 – adni-merge ADAS Total score-11 items. Classic 70 point total. Excludes Q4 (Delayed Word Recall) and Q14 (Number Cancellation).   ADAS 13 – adni-merge ADAS Total score-13 items. 85 point total including Q4 (Delayed Word Recall) and Q14 (Number Cancellation).

MoCA Total Scores refer to the final count obtained by patients after the complete test is performed   UPDRS Total integer Null The unified Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s disease rating scale (UPDRS) is used to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s disease.

The \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;Other\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; category refers to Alzheime\u0026rsquo;s related diagnosis which origin can be traced to other pathology eg. vascular.

	"content": " Code Versioning and Working Practice  The code of the MIP is versioned into Github. Each project should contain at least a master branch and a stable branch. The stable branch should contain only strongly tested code that can be used in a production environment. The master branch should contain the latest working features that needs to be strongly tested before being merged to the stable branch. Each developer should create new branches (usually from the master branch) to implement new features and/or to fix bugs. No one should directly commit changes into the stable or master branch. Once feature/bug-fix branch is working the branch can be merged into the master one. For big changes, a merge request should be created and assigned to another developer. AUTOMATION: The stable branch should never be updated manually. The CI system should look for changes in the master branch and automatically run some tests on it. If the automatic tests are successfully passed, the CI system will create a merge request from the master branch to the stable branch or automatically do the merge.  Testing (Unit and Integration)  Each component should include unit tests which should be executed each time will build it. Each built component (usually a Docker image) should also be tested with integration tests before being pushed on a repository (usually Docker Hub). These tests are needed by the CI system to decide whether a feature can be considered stable enough for the stable branch.  Docker Images Versioning As Docker is a key technology in our platform, each Docker component we build should be versioned using a \u0026quot;Git commit hash\u0026quot; and pushed on Docker Hub (at https://hub.docker.com/u/hbpmip/) or on our private Docker Registry server. In this way, we will always be able to retrieve the precise code (on GitLab) that was used to build an Docker image.\nWe also will be able to rollback or commit a new version of a component in a very easy way.\nBinaries Versioning As a few components like libraries should be built for \u0026quot;non-docker\u0026quot; use. These will be versioned and pushed on Artifactory.\n"

If your data has been prepared for data sharing and follows the I2B2 standard, this effort will fasten the inclusion of your data in the platform.\nPACS system MIP can connect to and query any PACS system compatible with the DICOM standard.\nTo better protect your clinical PACS, we recommend that you put in place a research PACS that will contain only the selection of medical images available for research.\nOther Ways Of Integrating Data In The MIP Provided some development or configuration on our side, we can support the following methods of integrating data into MIP.\nFiles extract We can ingest data extract provided as a set of files.\nFor MRI data, files can be in the DICOM or NIFTI formats.

It uses the data mapping and transformation specifications provided by the DGDS committee to select the variables of interest and normalise them into the MIP Common Data Elements reference.\nThis pipeline provides the final results produced by the Data Factory.\n   From Data Factory output specifications     The ouput of Data Factory is a set of research-grade data containing the biomarkers extracted from MRI scans and the variables extracted from the patient (or research subject) EHR records.This information is sent to the Hospital Database and provided to the machine learning and statistical analysis algorithms of the Algorithm Factory as well as the distributed queries when the instance of MIP at a hospital is connected to the Federation.

	"content": " Database with an I2B2 schema storing all information harvested onsite The Capture database enables the collection of lots of information coming from the hospital EHR data or from research cohort metadata in an unaltered way.\nAt this point, no attempt is made to select or transform the data to fit into the MIP Common Data Elements.\nThis database serves purely the data curation process: data elements are identified, described, collected and managed in a database.\nTo support the capture of as much information as possible, we have adopted the widely used I2B2 database schema, a variant of the star schema commonly used in data marts\nAn interesting consequence of this choice is that as several research databases and hospital data exports for research use I2B2, the data importation process is a simple database copy.\n"
