_Import of data in LDSM Once the harmonised data is available in the i2b2, it is made available in the LDSM through csv files and exposed to the Web Portal and Exareme as tables. The current schema is based on the requirement of the Web Portal and the available variables. Currently (July 2017), the schema used is a big table containing one column per variable, and one line per patient and visit._

### The different versions of MIP

- MIP Local: installed at hospitals and providing only local access to the hospital data
- MIP Federated: the next version that will connect hospitals to a master node and enable distributed queries and statistical analysis.
