The ouput of Data Factory is a set of research-grade data containing the biomarkers extracted from MRI scans and the variables extracted from the patient (or research subject) EHR records.

This information is sent to the [Hospital Database](../../hospital-database) and provided to the machine learning and statistical analysis algorithms of the [Algorithm Factory](../../algorithm-factory) as well as the [distributed queries](../../hospital-database/distributed-queries/) when the instance of MIP at a hospital is connected to the Federation.
