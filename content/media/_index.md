- New machine learning techniques and algorithms : k-nearest neighbor, Gaussian Process Regression, SVM, Random Forest
- Experiments: user can create Experiments on existing models (own or shared), configure and apply cross-validation partitions, run the Experiments to view results, save the Experiments and optionally share them with the MIP Community
- Integration of Experiments into existing MIP functionality (My Data, My Community, Article writting, Biological Signatures of Diseases) - i.e. visualise experiments and their running status, see related experiments (based on same model), include experiment results when writing articles
- Apps section revamped (style improved + voting) (please note that the Apps section is still in the incipient phase and further work will be engaged to improve it)
- Epidemiological Exploration : user may now select a whole group of variables for configuration and creation of Models

### First public release of the MIP (March 2016)</h3>

### The HBP Medical Informatics Platform

The Medical Informatics Platform (MIP), built by Subproject 8 of the Human Brain Project, is a web-based platform allowing users not only to share data and know-how, but also to collaborate in a true translational way.
