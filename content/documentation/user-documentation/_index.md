| rs11136000_T    | Genetic    | adni-merge        | rs11136000 is a SNP associated with the clusterin CLU gene, which has also been known as the APOJ gene. A study of over 5,000 Alzheimer's disease patients (and over 10,000 controls) found a slight protective effect of the (T) allele of this SNP. rs11136000(T) carriers had a slightly decreased risk for Alzheimer's disease, with an odds ratio of 0.84 (CI: 0.8-0.9, p=1.4x10e-9). The association of this SNP and late-onset Alzheimer's disease was replicated over a total of another 1829 cases (and 2576 controls). |
