The whole stack of the MIP is based on DCOS and docker technologies. Therefore any linux distributions supporting a fairly recent version of docker represents the strict minimum. More specifically we support the following distribution out of the box:

- Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux > 7.2
- CentOS > 7.2 (soon)

OpenSSH server must also be installed and running to allow our deployment team to initiate the setup process.
